Additional Data That Could Improve Churn Prediction
1️⃣ Customer Usage Behavior (Very Important)

Examples:

Daily / monthly data usage

Call duration and frequency

Peak vs off-peak usage

Sudden drop in usage


Customers who reduce usage suddenly are strong churn signals — much stronger than demographics.

2️⃣ Customer Support & Complaint Data

Examples:

Number of complaints

Support tickets raised

Resolution time

Complaint category (billing, network, service)

Why it helps:
Frequent complaints + slow resolution = high churn probability.

This data is extremely predictive in real companies.

3️⃣ Payment & Billing Behavior

Examples:

Late payments

Failed transactions

Change in payment method

Bill disputes


Payment friction often happens just before churn.

4️⃣ Engagement & Interaction Data

Examples:

App or website login frequency

Email / SMS offer interaction

Response to promotions

Customer portal activity


Low engagement usually means low attachment to the service.

5️⃣ Network / Service Quality Metrics

Examples:

Call drops

Internet speed issues

Outage history by location

Signal strength

Why it helps:
Poor service quality is a direct churn driver, especially in telecom.

6️⃣ Competitor & Market Data 
Examples:

Competitor pricing changes

New competitor launches in customer’s area

Port-out requests

Why it helps:
Churn is often triggered by external market events, not internal factors.

7️⃣ Customer Lifecycle Events

Examples:

Plan upgrades or downgrades

Recent contract renewal
